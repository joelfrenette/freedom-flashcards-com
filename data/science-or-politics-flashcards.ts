    front: "If science evolves, why were dissenting views banned?",
    back: "Real science requires debate and questioning. Yet doctors were banned, scientists were fired, and research was censored for questioning COVID policies. Fauci said 'I am the science.' No, that's religion. Science welcomes challenges - propaganda silences them.",

    id: "sop-2",
    front: "Why were natural immunity and lab leak theories censored?",
    back: "Natural immunity was known science for centuries. Lab leak was plausible from day one. Both were labeled 'misinformation' and censored. Two years later? Both accepted as fact. The 'science' changed when the politics did.",

    front: "What's the difference between climate models and weather predictions?",
    back: "Weather predictions are accurate 3-5 days out. Climate models claim to predict 50-100 years accurately, despite failing every prediction since the 1970s. We were promised ice-free poles by 2013, flooded cities by 2000. Still waiting. How is this science?",

    front: "Why did mask recommendations flip-flop every month?",
    back: "March 2020: Masks don't work. April: Everyone wear masks. May: Double mask. June: Masks protect others, not you. Studies show minimal effectiveness, but questioning masks became heresy. Science doesn't change weekly - but politics does.",

    id: "sop-5",
    front: "If vaccines stop transmission, why do vaccinated people spread COVID?",
    back: "We were told vaccines stop spread - they don't. Biden said 'you won't get COVID if vaccinated' - lie. Fauci said 'dead end for the virus' - wrong. When facts contradicted narrative, they changed definitions. That's not science - it's marketing.",

    id: "sop-6",
    front: "Why can't we question the temperature data adjustments?",
    back: "Historical temperature data keeps getting 'adjusted' to show more warming. Past temperatures revised downward, recent ones revised upward. These adjustments always support the climate agenda. Question them and you're a 'denier.' Real science welcomes scrutiny of methodology.",

    front: "How many genders does biology recognize?",
    back: "Biology recognizes two sexes based on reproductive systems. Intersex conditions are rare abnormalities, not additional sexes. Yet we're told questioning this is 'anti-science.' Since when does science bend to political pressure? Chromosomes don't care about feelings.",

    id: "sop-8",
    front: "Why did 'two weeks to flatten the curve' become two years?",
    back: "Science said 'two weeks.' Politics kept extending it. Lockdowns caused more harm than good - destroyed businesses, increased deaths of despair, damaged children's development. But questioning lockdowns was 'anti-science.' No, following failed policies blindly is anti-science.",

    front: "If CO2 is pollution, why do greenhouses pump it in?",
    back: "Greenhouses increase CO2 to 1,000+ ppm for optimal plant growth. Earth is at 420 ppm. Satellite data shows Earth greening due to increased CO2. Plants need it to survive. Yet it's labeled 'carbon pollution.' Political narrative, not science.",

    front: "Why did deaths 'from COVID' equal deaths 'with COVID'?",
    back: "Dying in a car crash with COVID? COVID death. Stage 4 cancer patient with COVID? COVID death. Financial incentives paid hospitals more for COVID deaths. The numbers were inflated deliberately. Question it? You're a conspiracy theorist. Until the CDC quietly admitted it.",

    back: "Europe banned child transition after studies showed harm. Sweden, Finland, UK all reversed course. Yet US doctors push hormones and surgery on confused kids. Puberty blockers cause permanent damage. Questioning this? 'Transphobic.' What happened to 'first, do no harm'?",

  {
    id: "sop-12",
    front: "Why did the vaccine definition change?",
    back: "Pre-2021 CDC definition: Vaccine produces immunity. Post-2021: Vaccine produces protection. They changed the definition because COVID vaccines don't provide immunity. Rather than admit failure, they changed the meaning of words. Orwell called this Newspeak.",

    id: "sop-13",
    front: "If consensus equals science, why was Einstein ridiculed?",
    back: "Scientific consensus said Newtonian physics was settled. Einstein challenged it and was right. Galileo was persecuted for heliocentric theory. Consensus has been wrong repeatedly. Real science challenges consensus - it doesn't worship it.",

    id: "sop-14",
    front: "Why do climate models ignore water vapor?",
    back: "Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas - 95% of greenhouse effect. CO2 is 3-4%. Yet models focus on CO2 because it's politically controllable. You can't tax water vapor. The science follows the money and power.",

    front: "How did ivermectin become 'horse dewormer'?",
    back: "Ivermectin won a Nobel Prize for human use. Billions of doses given safely. But when doctors suggested it for COVID, media called it 'horse dewormer' and it was banned. Studies showing effectiveness were suppressed. Why? Because it was off-patent and cheap.",

    id: "sop-16",
    front: "Why are fossil fuels called that if they're not from fossils?",
    back: "Russian scientists showed petroleum can form without organic matter. Earth produces hydrocarbons abiotically. The 'fossil fuel' term implies scarcity to justify high prices and control. We've been finding 'peak oil' for 100 years. It's marketing, not geology.",

    front: "If masks work, why didn't flu disappear before COVID?",
    back: "We were told masks stop respiratory viruses. Yet flu circulated freely every year pre-COVID. Suddenly during lockdowns, flu vanished completely. Either masks suddenly worked for flu but not COVID, or they were misdiagnosing flu as COVID. Both scenarios show the lies.",

    id: "sop-18",
    front: "Why did peer review fail during COVID?",
    back: "Lancet published fake hydroxychloroquine study from fake company. Retracted. NEJM published flawed studies. Retracted. 'Peer review' approved propaganda quickly, suppressed dissent slowly. The scientific process was corrupted by political pressure and pharmaceutical money.",

    front: "How is renewable energy 'green' with toxic battery mining?",
    back: "Electric car batteries require lithium, cobalt, and rare earth mining - environmentally devastating. Solar panels contain toxic materials. Wind turbines kill millions of birds. Nuclear is cleanest but opposed. 'Green energy' is political branding, not environmental science.",

    id: "sop-20",
    front: "Why did they test COVID vaccines on people instead of animals?",
    back: "Traditional vaccine development takes 10+ years with animal trials. COVID vaccines skipped long-term testing. When critics questioned this, they were censored. Pfizer wanted data hidden for 75 years. That's not transparency - that's hiding something.",
