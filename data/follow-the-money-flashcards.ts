Mitch McConnell went from $3M to $35M. They claim it's 'savvy investing,' but they have access to insider information that would put regular citizens in prison.",

Meanwhile, small businesses were forced to close while big corporations stayed open. Who decided which businesses were 'essential'?",

Hunter Biden sat on Burisma's board making $50K/month with no experience. Follow the money and it always leads back home.",

They claim coincidence, but they vote on bills affecting these companies. Regular Americans go to prison for insider trading - why not Congress?",

    back: "Big Pharma spent $350 million lobbying in 2021. The same politicians voting on drug pricing regulations receive massive donations. Pfizer paid out $2.3 billion for fraudulent marketing. They're not donating out of generosity - they're buying influence and protection.",

    back: "The wealthy own assets that inflate while the middle class holds cash that loses value. When $6 trillion was printed during COVID, billionaire wealth increased 70% while real wages declined. Wall Street got bailouts, Main Street got inflation. The system isn't broken - it's working exactly as designed for those at the top.",

    back: "They don't. Section 230 protections are worth billions. Government contracts and favorable regulations are the payment. Facebook, Twitter, and Google suppress dissent in exchange for monopoly status. They're not private companies - they're government contractors enforcing narrative control.",

Haiti received billions after the earthquake - most Haitians never saw a dime. Foreign aid is taxpayer-funded money laundering.",

    front: "How do ESG scores make banks richer?",
    back: "Banks created ESG scoring to control which businesses get loans. They charge fees for ESG ratings, consulting, and compliance. BlackRock manages $10 trillion using ESG to force political agendas. It's not about ethics - it's about financial institutions controlling the economy through social engineering.",

    front: "Why do politicians oppose term limits?",
    back: "Career politicians become millionaires through corruption, insider trading, and influence peddling. Term limits would end their gravy train. They claim 'experience matters' but really mean 'our corruption networks take time to build.' They'll never vote to end their own meal ticket.",
