    front: "Why did the media call the laptop story disinformation?",
    back: "51 intelligence officials signed a letter calling it 'Russian disinformation' with zero evidence. Twitter and Facebook censored the story weeks before the 2024 election. Two years later, even the New York Times admitted the laptop was real. They didn't make a mistake - they ran interference for Biden.",

    front: "Which outlets repeated 'mostly peaceful protests' while cities burned?",
    back: "CNN reported 'fiery but mostly peaceful protests' with buildings burning behind the reporter. MSNBC downplayed $2 billion in damages and dozens of deaths. When Trump supporters protested, suddenly protests were 'insurrections.' The narrative depends on who's protesting, not what's happening.",

    front: "Why were dissenting doctors silenced during the pandemic?",
    back: "Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA technology, was banned for questioning vaccines. Dr. Peter McCullough was censored for advocating early treatment. YouTube deleted videos from Stanford and Harvard epidemiologists. If the science was 'settled,' why did they need to silence scientists?",

    back: "MSNBC devoted 455 segments to Russia collusion in 2018. The Mueller Report found no collusion. Not a single person was charged with conspiracy with Russia. Maddow never apologized. She won awards for spreading a hoax. That's not journalism - that's propaganda.",

    front: "Why did the media ignore Andrew Cuomo's nursing home deaths?",
    back: "Cuomo sent COVID patients into nursing homes, causing 15,000+ deaths. Media gave him an Emmy and praised his 'leadership.' When the scandal finally broke, coverage was minimal. Compare that to relentless attacks on DeSantis who kept Florida open with better outcomes.",

    front: "When did 'conspiracy theory' become code for 'wait six months'?",
    back: "Lab leak? Conspiracy. Now accepted. Vaccine injuries? Conspiracy. Now documented. Inflation from money printing? Conspiracy. Now obvious. Media labels inconvenient truths as 'conspiracy theories' until they can't hide them anymore. The pattern is clear.",

    front: "Why do 90% of journalists donate to Democrats?",
    back: "Surveys show 90%+ of journalists are Democrats. They live in Democrat cities, send kids to Democrat schools, and socialize with Democrats. Then they claim to report 'objectively.' You can't be objective when you're part of the team you're supposed to cover.",

    back: "Washington Post won a Pulitzer for Russia coverage - based on lies. New York Times, CNN, MSNBC repeated the hoax for years. When it fell apart? No Pulitzer returned. No apologies. No accountability. They knowingly spread propaganda and got awards for it.",

    back: "Biden claimed he graduated top of his class - he was 76th out of 85. Said he was arrested seeing Mandela - never happened. Claimed he visited Tree of Life synagogue - security footage proves he didn't. Facebook 'fact-checkers' were silent. Fact-checking is political enforcement, not truth.",

    front: "When did anonymous sources become journalism?",
    back: "'Sources say...' 'Officials claim...' 'Experts believe...' The Russia hoax relied entirely on anonymous sources. When stories fall apart, no one is held accountable because no one is named. Anonymous sources are how journalists launder their political opinions into 'news.'",

    back: "Kyle Rittenhouse shot three white men in self-defense. All were criminals, one was a pedophile. Yet media called him a white supremacist and said he 'crossed state lines with an illegal gun' - both lies. When he was acquitted, they doubled down rather than admit they lied.",

    front: "How many times did CNN use 'bombshell' that wasn't?",
    back: "Every week during Trump's presidency: 'BOMBSHELL report...' 'Walls are closing in...' 'The beginning of the end...' None of it was true. It was a four-year PSYOP to keep viewers engaged. They're not reporting news - they're manufacturing rage for ratings.",

    front: "Why did Twitter allow ISIS but ban Trump?",
    back: "Twitter allowed Taliban leaders, ISIS accounts, and Iranian mullahs calling for death to America. But Trump, a sitting president, was permanently banned. The Ayatollah threatening nuclear war? Still there. It's not about 'safety' - it's about political control.",

    front: "When did questioning elections become 'threatening democracy'?",
    back: "Democrats questioned 2000, 2004, and 2016 elections - media supported it. Hillary Clinton still calls 2016 'stolen.' Stacey Abrams never conceded Georgia. But questioning 2020? That's 'insurrection.' The rules change based on who wins.",

    front: "Why do newspapers bury corrections on page 12?",
    back: "Fake news gets front page coverage. Corrections get buried weeks later in tiny print. The lie spreads to millions; the correction reaches thousands. This isn't accidental - it's intentional manipulation. The damage is done and they know it.",

    front: "How did media ignore Biden's cognitive decline?",
    back: "Anyone watching could see Biden's deterioration. Videos showed confusion, inability to complete sentences, getting lost on stage. Media called it a 'stutter' and 'cheap fakes.' They gaslit America for years rather than report the obvious truth.",

    id: "mn-17",
    front: "Why do journalists attend Democrat fundraisers?",
    back: "Leaked emails show journalists attending Clinton campaign events. They send articles to campaigns for approval. George Stephanopoulos donated to Clinton Foundation while hosting political debates. They're not observers - they're participants disguised as journalists.",

    id: "mn-18",
    front: "When did 'our democracy' replace 'the republic'?",
    back: "Suddenly every speech is about 'saving our democracy' - from the people voting 'wrong.' A republic protects minority rights; democracy is mob rule. They want democracy when they control the mob, and they want to eliminate the republic's safeguards against tyranny.",

    front: "Why did media ignore Joe Biden's Ukraine corruption?",
    back: "Biden bragged on camera about getting Ukrainian prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold aid. His son Hunter was on Burisma's board making millions. Media: nothing to see here. If Trump did the same thing? Impeachment. Oh wait - they impeached him for asking about it.",

    front: "How many narratives collapsed when Elon bought Twitter?",
    back: "Twitter Files revealed: FBI paid Twitter to censor Americans. Government agencies directed content moderation. Media coordination to suppress stories. Shadow banning of conservatives. The 'conspiracy theories' were all true. That's why they fought so hard to stop the purchase.",
